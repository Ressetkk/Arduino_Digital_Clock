# Arduino Digital Clock
This is implementation of fully digital Arduino Digital Clock.
It it partially optimized for working with 2 AA alkaline batteries connected in serial.
Program runs on ATMega328P based Arduino working on 3.3V @ 16MHz. It's quite stable.

## Build
Sketch *Requires* using Arduino 1.6.9 due to Squawk library incompatibility with newer versions of Arduino IDE.
